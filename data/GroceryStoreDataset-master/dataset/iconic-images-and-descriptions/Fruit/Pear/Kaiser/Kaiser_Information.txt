Title: Pear Bosc-kaiser Class 1 
Country and volume: Italy,Â ca 150g 
Description: The Kaiser Pear is drip-shaped with matte, medium-thick, flaming yellow-brown or brownish shell. The yellowish white pulp is crispy, juicy and sweet, with some fresh acid. Kaiser pears match very well with dessert cheeses and wine, but it is also good to cook, as it retains its shape well.
