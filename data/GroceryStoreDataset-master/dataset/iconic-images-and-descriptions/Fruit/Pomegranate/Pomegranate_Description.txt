Pomegranate has a sweet, gentle and refreshing taste, making pomegranate suitable for salads and desserts. It is only the kernels of the fruit that you eat. These are taken out by first cutting around the apple without destroying the core. Then turn both halves in opposite directions until they loosen. Finally, the kernels are loosened by knocking a wooden slab on the shell of the half, preferably over a bowl.
