Fresh standard milk made from Swedish milk from Arlag√•rdar. The taste is round and full of clear flavors of cream. This makes it extra good for coffee, tea and chocolate. Standard milk can also be used for cooking, berries and porridge. Milk is a natural source of, for example, protein, calcium and vitamin B12. Protein contributes to muscle building and calcium is needed to maintain a normal bone structure. The brand Arla Ko guarantees that the product is made of 100 percent Swedish milk.
