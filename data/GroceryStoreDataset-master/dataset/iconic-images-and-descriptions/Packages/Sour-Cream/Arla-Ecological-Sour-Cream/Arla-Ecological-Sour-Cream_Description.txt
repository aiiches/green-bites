KRAV-labeled sour cream made from fresh cream from Swedish organic Arlag√•rdar. Sour cream is a real classic that has its obvious place for both everyday and weekend. It has an acidic, creamy and fresh taste with a slightly creamy consistency and is excellent as a natural accessory or as a base in cold sauces and dressings. With its fresh acid it softens the heat from spicy dishes. The brand Arla Ko guarantees that the product is made of 100% Swedish milk.
