Creamy, slightly more acidic yoghurt with a clear yoghurt character. Acidic with selected bacterial strains giving extra clear yoghurt aroma. The yoghurt tastes as good for breakfast as snack and fits well with nuts, honey and fresh berries. With its creamy texture and clear acid, it is also great for kebab sauce, baking bread and yoghurt drinks. The brand Arla Ko guarantees that the product is made of 100% Swedish milk.
