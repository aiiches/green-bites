Ginger is a herb with a characteristically sharp taste. It is used for flavoring and accessories, especially in Asian cuisine. Vegetables and curries, rice, pickles, meat and fish are good for flavoring with ginger. The rich aroma also fits well with cookies, biscuits, marmalades and sweet desserts.
