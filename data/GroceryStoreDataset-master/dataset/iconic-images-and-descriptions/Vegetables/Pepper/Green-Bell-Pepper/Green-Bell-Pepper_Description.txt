There are a variety of colors of peppers. The most common ones are green, yellow, orange, red and white. The paprika always starts as green, but then shifts color when the it becomes more ripe. A green pepper is an unripe and hence a little firmer than the other ones, making it suitable for warm dishes, for example chili con carne, pies, gratin and various pots.
